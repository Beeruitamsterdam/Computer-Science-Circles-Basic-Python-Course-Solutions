# Computer-Science-Circles-Basic-Python-Course-Solutions
I followed an online course about Python at CSC University of Waterloo Canada

When looking for some online courses about Python i came to the site: https://cscircles.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/.
They have a basic course where you get to know Python. It has 18 chapters with lessons. Each chapter has some exercises.
While i strugled my way thru, i tried to find some answers on the internet. But nowhere i could find the solutions to all the exercises. At least not for free.
I found some sites where i had to make an account and register with a creditcard, which i do not own.

Well, now i have completed the course, i thought of making a list of solutions myself and share them. And what will be a better place then here at GitHub.
Please bear with me for i do not know how long it takes to gather al the information and put it down here.

If you have tips, ideas or other solutions, mail me at mailto:beeruitamsterdam@live.nl.

I hope you will have fun following this course too.
